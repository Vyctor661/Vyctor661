- [x] 📫 How to reach me: Well you can reach me via discord ([Vyctor661#2132](https://discordapp.com/users/270972671490129921)) I'm spending most of my time on there with my amazing community but you can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Vyctor661) (ᴡᴏᴜʟᴅɴ'ᴛ ᴍɪɴᴅ ᴀ ғᴏʟʟᴏᴡ ʜᴇʀᴇ ᴇɪᴛʜᴇʀ ʜᴇʜ);
